\begin{abstract}
This project explores how workplace and personal factors may influence whether people in the tech industry seek help for mental health concerns. Using the \dataset{} dataset from Kaggle, we will apply basic data mining methods learned in class to clean and analyze the data, visualize important patterns, and build models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. The goal is to understand which factors are most related to seeking treatment and to make clear, easy-to-interpret results supported by plots and basic evaluation measures.

Using this processed dataset, we frame MSRP prediction as a supervised regression problem and construct a unified preprocessing pipeline combining imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding. On this common feature space, we benchmark several models: ridge-regularised decisiion trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. Logistic regression emerges as the best model, reducing test RMSE by roughly 40\% compared with the naive baseline and clearly outperforming ridge and LightGBM, especially for Logistic regression. Residual and diagnostic analyses show that the model fits the bulk of the market well, with remaining errors concentrated in the sparse, very high-end segment. Overall, the study demonstrates an end-to-end workflow---from exploration and feature engineering to modern gradient-boosting regression---for accurate and interpretable mental health prediction.

\section{Data}

\subsection{Data Description}

\subsubsection{source of data}

The data was collected from the publicly available Kaggle dataset “Car Price Prediction Challenge”
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

\subsubsection{Number of rows (tuples), and number of features (attributes)}

The dataset includes 1259 rows and 27 attributes, with each row representing a survey individual.

\section{Logistic Regression Model}

In this section we focus on a logistic regression model to predict whether a respondent seeks mental health treatment. The target variable is \texttt{treatment} (1 = Yes, 0 = No), and the input features capture both personal background and workplace factors.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

We first performed a basic cleaning and preprocessing step on the survey data:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Removed records with missing or invalid values in the target variable \texttt{treatment}.
  \item Filtered out clearly unreasonable age values and restricted the range to working-age adults.
  \item Selected features that are plausibly related to treatment, including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item numeric: \texttt{Age};
    \item categorical: \texttt{Gender}, \texttt{family\_history}, \texttt{work\_interfere}, \texttt{care\_options}, \texttt{anonymity}, \texttt{leave}, \texttt{no\_employees}, and several other workplace-related attributes.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Applied one-hot encoding to all categorical variables, with one level dropped per feature to avoid exact multicollinearity.
  \item Standardized the numeric feature(s) so that they have zero mean and unit variance.
  \item Performed an 80/20 train--test split, stratified by the \texttt{treatment} label to preserve class proportions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model and Training Procedure}

Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) denote the preprocessed feature vector for one respondent and \(y \in \{0,1\}\) the treatment label. Logistic regression models the probability of seeking treatment as
\[
P(y=1 \mid x) = \sigma(w^\top x + b),
\]
where \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\) and \(b\in\mathbb{R}\) are the model parameters and \(\sigma(\cdot)\) is the sigmoid function.

We use the standard cross-entropy loss with L2 regularization:
\[
\mathcal{L}(w,b) =
 -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \big[y_i \log \hat{p}_i + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{p}_i)\big]
 + \lambda \|w\|_2^2,
\]
where \(\hat{p}_i = P(y_i=1\mid x_i)\). In practice we use the \texttt{LogisticRegression} implementation from scikit-learn with L2 penalty and a default regularization strength, trained on the 80\% training subset.

\subsection{Evaluation Results}

On the held-out test set of 250 respondents, the logistic regression model achieves the following performance:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Accuracy: \textbf{0.848}
  \item Confusion matrix (rows = true class, columns = predicted class):
        \[
        \begin{bmatrix}
        97 & 27 \\
        11 & 115
        \end{bmatrix}
        \]
        where class 0 corresponds to \texttt{no treatment} and class 1 corresponds to \texttt{treatment}.
  \item For the \texttt{treatment} class (class 1):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Precision: 0.81
    \item Recall: 0.91
    \item F1-score: 0.86
  \end{itemize}
  \item For the \texttt{no treatment} class (class 0):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Precision: 0.90
    \item Recall: 0.78
    \item F1-score: 0.84
  \end{itemize}
  \item Macro and weighted F1-scores are both approximately 0.85.
\end{itemize}

The high recall of the treatment class indicates that the model correctly identifies the majority of respondents who report seeking treatment. At the same time, the precision for both classes remains reasonably high, so the number of false positives is limited.

\subsection{Interpretation of Coefficients}

Because logistic regression is a linear model in the log-odds domain, the learned coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of each feature on the probability of treatment. The largest positive coefficients correspond to variables such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{work\_interfere\_Sometimes}, \texttt{work\_interfere\_Often}, and \texttt{work\_interfere\_Rarely};
  \item \texttt{family\_history\_Yes};
  \item \texttt{care\_options\_Yes} and \texttt{anonymity\_Yes};
  \item certain levels of \texttt{leave} (e.g., \texttt{Somewhat difficult} or \texttt{Very difficult}).
\end{itemize}
These features all increase the log-odds of seeking treatment, indicating that respondents whose work is affected by mental-health issues, who have a family history of mental illness, and who perceive more support or resources at work are more likely to seek professional help.

Conversely, some gender-related dummy variables have negative coefficients, suggesting that, relative to the baseline category, certain gender groups are less likely to report treatment. Because of the one-hot encoding and imbalanced group sizes, these coefficients need to be interpreted with caution and should not be taken as causal.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
